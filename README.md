# Regression Analysis Solutions

## Project Overview
The "Regression Analysis Solutions" project demonstrates the use of regression techniques to analyze and predict outcomes based on data. This project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook file (`Regression_Analysis_Solutions.ipynb`) and includes code for performing linear regression, polynomial regression, and other related techniques.

## Data Source
The datasets used for this project are sourced from publicly available repositories. Specific details about the datasets and their sources are referenced within the Jupyter Notebook.

- **Primary Data Source**: 
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

## Project Structure
- `Regression_Analysis_Solutions.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for regression analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the analysis.
- `output/`: Folder for visualizations and regression results.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Summary
This project covers various regression techniques, including simple linear regression, multiple regression, and polynomial regression. The goal is to fit models to data and interpret the results.
